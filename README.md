# Django Calendar

This was my first ever project that I created while during my time in Coding Dojo(full-stack software development coding bootcamp).It is an event calendar built based of Djangoâ€™s HTMLCalendar and class based view. This project was completed in 5 days.

## Comments from the dev

Because this is my first ever project, I'm aware of that the code, design, structure etc. was not ideal and there will probably not be any changes to it. However, I believe it shows my potential after only 6 weeks of software development training.

This project is dear to me as this is first project where I wanted to explore how far I can learn and build within 5 days of dedicated time on it.

### Completion Date: October 2019
